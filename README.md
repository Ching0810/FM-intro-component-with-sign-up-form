## Overview

### The challenge

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- SCSS custom properties
- Flexbox & grid system
- Position system
- Mobile-first workflow
- JS event & logic control

### What I learned

1. Follow mobile first principle to finish responsive web design
2. Use <picture>, <source> element to achieve RWD design
3. Use <img> element combine with object-fit, height & width property to control background image always as height as card
4. Use JS to control email validation, pop up custom error message with wrong email form

### Continued development

1. Simplify redundant class and merge multiple CSS setting
2. Input border color with email validation still exist weird performance (already fixed)
3. Input should automatically detect whether typed in email is validated and modify CSS setting

### Useful resources

None
